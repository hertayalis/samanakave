On April 22, Thomas announced that the residents had been filming a reality show together, and that it will debut on Netflix in "a while."</p><p>Before the residents become TV stars, you might want a refresher about who is currently part of the group (or, who has been participating in filming).&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where is the Hype House?</h2><p>Since the group was officially created in December of 2019, the physical location of the Hype House has changed several times. The members had been living in the former Clout House, but they made a move to a Mediterranean-style mansion in December of 2020.</p><p>Thomas Petrou, Alex Warren, and Kouvr Annon reportedly bought the Los Angeles home together, and it has served as the main filming spot for the Netflix series.</p><p>They Hype House members have been more secretive about the address to avoid getting unwanted visits from fans.</p><p>Who will be on the Netflix show?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Thomas Petrou</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Thomas put the group together, and he's been a social media star for the longest. The 22-year-old said that he led the charge with getting the Netflix show, and he previously lived at the Team 10 house.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Chase Hudson (Lil Huddy)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: instagram</span></figure><p>LilHuddy and former Hype House member Charli D'Amelio called it quits on their relationship in early 2020 amid rumors <a href=#>Chase cheated on Charli</a>... with Nessa Barrett.

She's too busy promoting her song, "Obsessed," and appearing on the final season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians.</p><p>She won't be on the Netflix show. Until she announces her departure from Hype House, she'll continue to be the most famous member.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Patrick Huston</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>This aspiring model currently boasts more than 900,000 followers on TikTok and regularly collaborates with fellow Hype House members in videos.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Nick Austin</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Nick's claim to fame?
