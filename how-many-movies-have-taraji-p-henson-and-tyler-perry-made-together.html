That was the first time they ever worked together, sprouting a fruitful creative collaboration that is still producing results.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-many-times-have-taraji-p-henson-and-tyler-perry-worked-together data-injectable=false>How many times have Taraji P. Henson and Tyler Perry worked together?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=694 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=244 data-current-count=244 data-injectable=false>The actress and director have made three films together, 2008’s The Family That Preys, 2009’s I Can Do Bad All by Myself, and 2018’s Acrimony. Although Henson played a supporting role in the first, she took front stage in the others.</p><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=620 data-injectable=true>“The first time I worked with him, I got to work with Kathy Bates and Alfre Woodard and Sanaa Lathan who I all look up to as an actress,” the award-winning actress told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Los Angeles Times</a> about her time making The Family That Preys. Henson played Pam, the daughter of Alfre Woodard’s matriarch character and sister of Sanaa Lathan’s opportunist Andrea.</p><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=241 data-injectable=false>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>, Henson was still reeling with the disappointment of her meager Benjamin Button salary when she took on the job, which pushed her to stand her ground and demand half a million dollars from Perry, who immediately agreed.</p><p data-characters=639 data-current-count=880 data-injectable=true>Of course, when The Curious Case of Benjamin Button came out, it catapulted Henson right to the front lines of the acting world, thanks to her Oscar-nominated turn as Queenie, but if it hadn’t been for Perry <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she wouldn’t have had an adequate baseline figure to negotiate her following roles</a>. “I’m grateful to Tyler for putting me on the road to being paid my worth,” the actress wrote in her 2016 memoir, Around the Way Girl, adding “It was he who gave me a fair wage to star in his movie, which ultimately raised my quote — the baseline pay I could negotiate going into subsequent movie deals.”</p><p data-characters=469 data-current-count=469 data-injectable=true>The opportunities the multi-hyphenate filmmaker brought to Henson’s career didn’t stop there. He called her the day after the Oscars in 2009 and offered her her first leading role in a movie ever in I Can Do Bad All By Myself, Henson told the Los Angeles Times. The Golden Globe-winning performer played struggling singer April, who is suddenly tasked with looking after her young nieces and nephews, forcing her to finally grow up and take responsibility.</p><p data-characters=492 data-current-count=492 data-injectable=false>It took almost 10 years for the duo to work together again in Acrimony, a psychological thriller film about a wife driven to the edge by her husband’s lying and deception. “He would always say, ‘I’m going to work with you again but it has to be right.’ So, I knew when he was calling that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he had something great. And he did,</a>” Henson shared. Explaining why she continues to work with Perry, the actress simply stated “I trust him. He gives me good jobs and good roles.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1sMOMppinsV2ivLe1xKxkoZmmmnq1rdGaoaJloGK1prrSqKVmmZ6ZerXFy56pZqiVp7%2B6ecyam55lpKS0psDHnqlo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jones-road-the-best-blush-review-6890852.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jones Road 'The Best Blush' Review">&larr;
