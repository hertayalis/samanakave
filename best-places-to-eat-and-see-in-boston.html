We flew into New York City and spent a few days exploring the city. Then we hopped on a Bolt Bus and headed to Boston. It’s about a 4 hour trip but the bus was so nice and comfortable and even had WiFi and outlets to charge phones. &nbsp;It cost us about $15 each to take the trip —&nbsp;<a href=#>Bolt Bus Info</a>.&nbsp;We flew out of Boston and it ended up cheaper than flying out of NYC. It even paid for all of our bus tickets! We loved being able to experience both cities and see the differences between these two popular cities.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0240-e1495905351572.jpg alt="Bolt Bus from NYC to Boston.

After much research, we decided that we wanted to be close to the North End since it is so rich in history and known for its incredible Italian food. I use Hotwire all of the time to find great hotel deals. We booked a boutique hotel called, The Boxer, for our stay in Boston. &nbsp;It was within walking distance of the North End which includes the Freedom Trail, Quincy Market, Old North Church, Boston Public Market and Mike’s Pastry. Plus it was only 10-15 minutes to the airport. We loved this location!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0287-e1495900029619.jpg alt="Best Places to Eat and See in Boston.
