During a recent performance in the UK, the R&B artist brought a female fan out to join him. He performed an ultra-steamy lap dance to 2007's "Take You Down" that had the crowd going wild. Breezy's dance moves were obviously wowing his audience. At the same time, the receiving patron's partner caught their intimate moment on camera. He subsequently posted it on TikTok to vent to the world about what he'd just witnessed.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"POV: Buying my girlfriend front row tickets to see Chris Brown … I want my £500 [$615 USD] and my girlfriend back," @dashthelith wrote in the caption of his since-deleted post. As The New York Post reports, the OP's comment section quickly flooded with other users insisting that he end his relationship due to the disrespect. "Girls with celeb crushes are red flags," one person wrote. "They would leave [you] in a heartbeat for that celeb crush." Another chimed in with, "As a man, I was like, 'That's Chris Brown.' But when she kissed him I would've dumped her too."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-chris-brown-s-ultra-steamy-lap-dances-land-him-in-trouble>Chris Brown's Ultra Steamy Lap Dances Land Him in Trouble</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In an also-deleted update video, @dashthelith confirmed that he allegedly ended things with his girlfriend following the salacious display. "Just to update everyone regarding the Chris Brown concert, I'm no longer with my girlfriend. She said she doesn't think what she did was wrong," he wrote in response to a question on his original video. Seeing as the TikToks were removed earlier this weekend, there's been speculation floating around that the entire stunt was simply for clout. Regardless, this certainly isn't the first time the Virginia native has been so up close and personal with fans.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While giving yet another lap dance, the 33-year-old was previously enraged by the woman recording him. Brown was so angry, in fact, that he threw his fan's phone while pulling off one of his signature moves. "F*CK DAT PHONE," Brown wrote on Instagram after the show. Thankfully for the embarrassed attendee, others made sure she and her cell were reunited at the end of the night.
