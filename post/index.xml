Well, Hunter x Hunter is that anime and part of its appeal lies in the fact that we love some characters and love to hate others. We just can’t help but want to learn more about them.
Recommended Videos At some point, Yoshihiro Togashi nearly dethroned one of the big three of Shonen. In fact, many anime and manga fans consider Hunter x Hunter to be one of the masterpieces that transform “the big trio” into a quartet, and I’m inclined to agree, especially when you consider that the main characters in Hunter x Hunter are much younger than most Shonen protagonists.</description></item><item><title>Ghanaians dont appreciate my father enough Jackie Ankrah</title><link>/ghanaians-dont-appreciate-my-father-enough-jackie-ankrah.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/ghanaians-dont-appreciate-my-father-enough-jackie-ankrah.html</guid><description>Ghanaian broadcast journalist and singer Jackie Ankrah says her father General J.

Unlike the typical lotions and creams, these formulas tend to be thick and luxurious. That gives them a dual benefit: They’re not only deeply nourishing for skin, but they can also serve as a built-in moment of self care, too. While more lightweight formulas may be top of mind during certain seasons (and if say, you struggle with body acne), few body-care products can top a body butter if you experience dryness, itchiness, or even skin conditions like eczema.</description></item><item><title>Altair: How to color when there are more categories than colors available</title><link>/altair-how-to-color-when-there-are-more-categories-than-colors-available.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/altair-how-to-color-when-there-are-more-categories-than-colors-available.html</guid><description>Here is the code taken from the Altair documentation on color schemes.
