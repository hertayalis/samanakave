In the wake of his sad demise, many want to know who the family members of the celebrated American television game show host are.</p><p>The long-running host of “The Price Is Right,” the most popular game show in American television history, and one of the most well-known supporters of animal rights in the nation, Bob Barker, passed away on Saturday at his home in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles. He was 99.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Roger Neal, a spokesman, made the announcement of his death.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>From 1956 until 1974, Mr. Barker hosted “Truth or Consequences,” and from 1972 on, he was most notably the host of “The Price Is Right.” Throughout this time, he was a staple of daytime television.</p><p>When “The New Price Is Right,” as it was then known, made its CBS debut as a revamped and jazzed-up version of the original “The Price Is Right,” which had been broadcast from 1956 to 1965, he began his 35-year tenure as its host. In addition, he hosted a nighttime version of a weekly syndicated show from 1977 until it was canceled in 1980.</p><p>He has left them now, but Bob Barker’s family members will be glad that he inspired many with his craft.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bob-barker-early-life><strong>Bob Barker Early Life</strong></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>On the Rosebud Indian Reservation near Mission, South Dakota, Barker spent most of his formative years. According to the U.S. Indian Census Rolls, 1885–1940, Barker is a Sioux tribal member who has enrolled in the tribe. His father, Byron John Barker, was the foreman of the electrical high line through the state of Washington, while his mother, Matilda (“Tillie”) Valandra (formerly Matilda Kent Tarleton), taught in the classroom.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Barker was one-eighth Sioux because his mother was non-Native and his father was a quarter Sioux. Barker went to Rosebud Reservation Elementary School, where his mother taught. I’ve always boasted about being part Indian because they are a people to be proud of, he once said. And among all of them, the Sioux were the best warriors.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>When Barker was in high school in Missouri, he met Dorothy Jo Gideon, who would become his wife, during an Ella Fitzgerald concert. They started dating when Barker was 15 years old. He received a basketball scholarship to attend Drury College (now Drury University) in Springfield, Missouri.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>He belonged to Drury’s Epsilon Beta chapter of the Sigma Nu fraternity. He enlisted in the United States Navy Reserve in 1943 to become a fighter pilot, although he did not participate in active duty. He married Dorothy Jo on January 12, 1945, when he was on military leave. He went back to Drury after the war to finish his studies, earning a summa cum laude in economics.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bob-barker-family-members-who-are-his-family-members><strong>Bob Barker Family Members: Who Are His Family Members?</strong></h2><p>Bob Barker’s family members are many. Anyone who comes closer to him becomes family. He was survived by Kent Valandra and Nancy Burnet. Nancy Burnet, a fellow animal rights activist who had been overseeing his care and about whom he wrote in his autobiography, “Our relationship has gone on for 25 years, off and on. Mostly on” is an executor of his estate.</p><p>Bob Barker and his wife, <strong><a href=#>Dorothy Jo Gideon</a></strong>, who were married for nearly four decades, <strong><a href=#>did not have any children</a></strong>.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In addition to a lifetime achievement Emmy in 1999, Mr. Barker received 14 Daytime Emmy Awards for his work as “The Price Is Right” host and four more for his work as executive producer. He once claimed that the reason why the show had endured so long was that “all our games are based on prices, and everyone can identify with that.” However, he went on to say that he had never personally learned the cost of anything and that if he had ever competed on such a show, he would have been “a total failure.”</p><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunDDx6hkmqqVYsGpsYyfmKahnK56rrHMm5yrq12ks26uzptkm5mioLKzew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./samsung-galaxy-s-5-review.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="WiFi, Cellular &amp;amp; Download Booster">&larr;
