He played one-on-one with Danilo Gallinari, his father’s Olimpia Milano teammate at the time, when he was 12 years old and visiting him in Milan.</p><p>Booker’s father instilled in him the idea that basketball intelligence was just as significant as natural athletic ability. Booker made friends with future NBA stars Tyler Ulis and D’Angelo Russell while they were both in middle school.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Devin Booker career</h2><p>Booker was chosen by the Phoenix Suns with the 13th overall choice in the 2015 NBA Draft on June 25, 2015.

He set a rookie record for the Phoenix Suns with six three-pointers on January 19 when he scored 32 points in a 97-94 loss to the Indiana Pacers.</p><p>At 19 years, 81 days old, Booker became the third-youngest player in NBA history to score 30 or more points in a game, trailing only LeBron James and Kevin Durant. He also became the youngest Suns player to do it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>In a defeat to the Miami Heat on March 3, Booker recorded a then-career-high 34 points. Booker scored 35 points, a career high, against the Denver Nuggets on March 10.</p><p>Booker trained with head coach Earl Watson and veteran NBA player Baron Davis at UCLA throughout the offseason. He was also given the opportunity to join the select team that trains against Team USA in advance of the Summer Olympics and participated in two games for the Suns during the Las Vegas Summer League.</p><p>In another 39-point performance on January 12, 2017, he scored 28 points in the fourth quarter to break Stephon Marbury’s previous record of 26 points from 2002 for the most points in a quarter for the Suns.</p><p>In a 98-92 loss against the Brooklyn Nets on November 6, 2017, Booker scored 18 points to achieve 3,000 career points and becoming the fourth-youngest player in NBA history to do so, behind LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Carmelo Anthony.</p><p>On July 7, 2018, Booker and the Suns agreed to a five-year, $158 million deal extension. After having surgery to replace his right hand’s fifth metacarpophalangeal joint, which was damaged on March 14, 2018, he was declared out for six weeks on September 10.</p><p>In a 100-98 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on November 23, 2019, Booker nearly recorded a triple-double with 35 points, a career-high 12 rebounds, and 9 assists.</p><p>Booker surpassed 8,000 points on January 22, 2021, in a 130-126 overtime defeat against the Denver Nuggets, during which he strained his left hamstring.</p><p>On November 29, 2021, during the 2021–22 NBA season, Booker received the Western Conference Player of the Week award for his play in Week 6 of the campaign, which enabled the Suns to set a franchise mark with an 18-game winning streak.</p><p>Booker and the Suns reached a four-year, $224 million contract agreement on July 7, 2022. That same day, he was revealed as one of the NBA 2K23 cover heroes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Does Devin Booker have any children?</h2><p>Devin Booker has no children at the time of filing this report.</p><p><strong>Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>www.Ghgossip.com</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jp2cr6GeYq%2Bwu8qeqWabmJ65pb7Ep2Sdp5WoeqWx1aKlZpqfpLimvoyhmK%2BdXaC2pb%2BO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./hope-olaide-wilson.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hope Olaide Wilson">&larr;
