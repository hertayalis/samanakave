They both come from parents well-versed in the entertainment industry. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>But the two had different approaches to their acting career. One of them did not even want to become an actress.</p><p>So, which one was it? Here are details about that, as well as other things about the sisters and their lives, together and apart. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Emily Deschanel and Zooey Deschanel's Birthdays</h2><p>Emily is the older of the two Deschanel siblings. She was born on October 11, 1976. Zooey, the younger sister, arrived four years later, on January 17, 1980.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p></p><p><strong>Emily Deschanel and her sister, Zooey Deschanel, circa 1983</strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>(Photo: Zooey Deschanel/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)<span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Their parents are Hollywood mainstays — their father is cinematographer and director Caleb Deschanel, and their mother is Mary Jo Deschanel (née Weir), an actress.</p><h2>The Deschanel Sisters' Ethnicity and Heritage</h2><p>Emily and Zooey share a lot of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">different ethnic backgrounds</a>.</p><p>Their paternal grandfather,&nbsp;Paul Jules Deschanel, was from&nbsp;Oullins, Rhône, France. He migrated to the U.S. in 1930 and started a family there, giving the sisters their French heritage. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Other than this, the sisters have some Quaker ancestry from Pennsylvania, courtesy of her paternal grandmother, Anna Ward Orr. Further, they have Deep Ohio, New York, and Irish, Swiss, English, and Dutch&nbsp;ancestry, thanks to their maternal side of the family.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Their LA&nbsp;Upbringing and Contrasting Views on That</h2><p>Both the siblings grew up in Los Angeles, but only one enjoyed it.</p><p>"The city has so many wonderful things to offer," Emily said about L.A. in a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">LA Mag</a> interview from April 2013. "Los Angeles will always be my home. I don't know if I could feel that way about another place.&nbsp;It's nice to be in one place and have a job that keeps me in L.A." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Zooey did not like the vibe L.A. gave, especially to girls.</p><p>"I just feel like growing up in Los Angeles, you learn, 'Well you're never gonna be the prettiest girl in the room, so just don't even try.'&nbsp;I mean, I care about being pretty, but it's not my most valued thing,"&nbsp;she told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Vulture</a> in September 2011.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Emily Used to Bully Zooey When They Were Little</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>As Emily is older than her sister, it is obvious she developed her acting abilities earlier. So, when they were young, she used to prank and bully Zooey into thinking absurd things.</p><p>Emily had Zooey convinced that "Neptunians had&nbsp;[taken] [her]&nbsp;real sister and replaced her with a facsimile who looked just like her."</p><p>Further elaborating on this, Emily said in an interview with <a href=# rel=follow>Conan</a>: "I would tell her… that I'd&nbsp;[hurt] her sister and taken over her body, and that I was going to kill her next." She would even make her cry and laugh afterward.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Eventually, Zooey got to a point where Emily had to do nothing but widen her eyes, and she would get scared.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>Only One of Them Completed College</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Emily is the only one to have completed college education between the two. The older sister attended Harvard-Westlake School and Crossroads School in Los Angeles. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Zooey, too, attended Crossroads and had Jake Gyllenhaal and Kate Hudson <a href=# rel="follow noopener">as her peers</a>. But, she soon realized her "specialness" was underappreciated at the school, and she dropped out, pursuing acting full-time.</p><h2>Emily and Zooey Had Different Visions for Career</h2><p>While Zooey went straight into acting, Emily had other plans. She always wanted to be an academic and pursue arts in that way.</p><p></p><p><strong>Emily Deschanel and her sister, Zooey Deschanel.</strong> (Photo: Zooey Deschanel/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>It was not that Emily did not like acting at all. Both loved doing plays when they were younger, but only Zooey knew she wanted to be an actress early on.</p><p>Emily instead wanted to be an architect. "I love architecture. I just love the combination between art and science, I guess," Emily said during the sisters' conversation with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Buddy TV</a> in December 2009. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><h2>They Have Different Diets</h2><p><a href=# rel=follow>Emily is a staunch vegan</a> and has been so since her teenage years. Zooey, however, is not even a vegetarian.</p><p>But not for a lack of trying. Zooey tried her sister's diet when she discovered she was allergic to dairy, wheat, and eggs. She tried to stay off meat because she thought it would be easy as she already could not eat all her favorite food, anyway.</p><p>"To be a gluten-free vegan is, like, the most difficult thing you can possibly be. And I lasted, like, six months," she told Vulture. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJ2dnrm6ecOeqpygkaOyrXnSoqqtnaJix7C7xLJknZ2jmLWiusSlZaGsnaE%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-isabel-may-related-to-faith-hill-parents-and-dating-status-explored.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Isabel May Related To Faith Hill?
