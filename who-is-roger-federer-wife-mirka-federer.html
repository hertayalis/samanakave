The couple met in 2000 while competing for Switzerland in the Olympics in Sydney.</p><p>Roger and Mirka married in 2009 after dating for nine years. The pair married on a gorgeous spring day in Roger’s birthplace of Basel, Switzerland, in the presence of their family and close friends.</p><p>The couple has been through both good and hard times since their marriage. On March 25, 2020, the tennis player shared a photo with his wife and declared that he and Marika had decided to contribute one million Swiss Francs to Switzerland’s most needy families during the epidemic.</p><p>The duo has also aided society and has always tried to help people in need. This demonstrates the couple’s generosity.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Wife_of_Roger_Federer_Mirka_Federer_was_a_tennis_player_as_well></span>Wife of Roger Federer Mirka Federer was a tennis player as well<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mirka was a professional tennis player who represented Switzerland at the 2000 Sydney Olympics.</p><p>When she was nine years old, her father accompanied her to a competition in Filderstadt, Germany. Mirka met Martina Navratilova, who encouraged her to pursue tennis since she appeared sporty. Navratilova later mailed her a racquet and set up her first tennis lesson.</p><p>In 2002, she competed in the Hopman Cup alongside Roger Federer. Her best Grand Slam performance came in 2001, when she reached the third round of the US Open.</p><p>She was forced to withdraw from tennis after suffering a career-ending foot injury. Despite being one of the top tennis players in the world, Roger has expressed a desire to remain humble. According to her, one should never forget one’s roots and should cherish and care for one’s family and friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.current-affairs.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Roger-Federer-And-His-Wife-Mirka-Federer-300x286.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Age_Gap_Between_Roger_Federer_and_Mirka_Federer></span>The Age Gap Between Roger Federer and Mirka Federer<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Roger Federer and Mirka Federer have a three-year age difference because she is 44 and he is 41.</p><p>Despite their modest age difference, the pair appears to be quite supportive and understanding. Mirka’s encouragement has contributed to the tennis pro’s longevity. He reportedly told the media after winning the Australian Open in 2017 that she was present, despite the fact that he had not won any tournaments.</p><p>Similarly, when Federer announced his retirement in September 2022, he acknowledged Mirka for her decades of support.</p><p>Mirka, according to his account, prepared him for the finals by watching countless matches. She even expressed her love and support for him during her eighth month of pregnancy. She has apparently put up with his funny side on the road with his crew for over 20 years.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Roger_Federer%E2%80%99s_Net_Worth_in_Comparison_to_His_Wife_Mirka></span>Roger Federer’s Net Worth in Comparison to His Wife Mirka<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Roger Federer has a net worth of $550 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.</p><p>Meanwhile, his wife Mirka’s tennis career has earned her a total career earnings of roughly $1 million. As a result, Roger unquestionably has a bigger net worth than his wife.</p><p>He is one of the world’s richest professional tennis players, having earned approximately $130.5 million in prize money plus a stunning $90 million in endorsements from businesses like Mercedes-Benz and Rolex.</p><p>According to Sportico, in June 2021, the 20-time Grand Slam singles champion will become the first tennis player to earn $1 billion in lifetime earnings from prize money, endorsements, and appearance fees.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.current-affairs.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Roger-Federer-And-His-Wife-Mirka-Federer-Got-Married-In-2009-293x300.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mirka_Federer_and_Roger_Federer_have_two_sons_and_two_daughters></span>Mirka Federer and Roger Federer have two sons and two daughters<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Only a few months after their wedding, Roger and Mirka received their first daughters, identical twins Charlene Riva and Myla Rose, in July 2009. Later, in 2014, they received another set of identical twins, boys Leo and Lenny.</p><p>The mother of four frequently takes her children to Roger’s games. When Roger won Wimbledon in 2017, Mirka and both sets of twins applauded him on from the stands.</p><p>According to ESPN, having children, being a father, and being married have all enhanced his life.</p><p>The tennis player also addressed his four amazing children, expressing how appreciative he is for their support and how excited they are to travel and create new memories. He will always treasure the feeling of seeing his loved ones cheering him on from the stands.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mirka_Federer_Wikipedia></span>Mirka Federer Wikipedia<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Miroslava Vavrinec was Mirka Federer’s first name. On April 1, 1978, she was born in what was then Czechoslovakia. She emigrated to Switzerland when she was two years old. Mirka went to see a tennis match when she was nine years old and met Martina Navratilova. Tennis legend John McEnroe advised she try her hand at the sport.</p><p>She finally became a professional in 1999, although she did not have much success. Off the court, though, she was about to meet someone who would change her life forever. A teenage Roger Federer, who went professional the same year as Mirka, was on the same team that competed in the Sydney Olympics in 2000.</p><p>Federer and Mirka met in the 2002 Hopman Cup, as fate would have it. Mirka’s best result in singles Grand Slam competition was a third-round showing in the 2001 US Open. Her career, however, was cut short due to recurring foot ailments. She declared her retirement in 2002. This was her watershed moment. After retiring, she became Roger Federer’s Public Relations Manager, accompanying him on tours around the world.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_Mirka_Federer%E2%80%99s_most_notable_sporting_achievement></span>What is Mirka Federer’s most notable sporting achievement?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mirka didn’t have a lot of Grand Slam success. In both 2000 and 2001, she advanced to the second round of the Australian Open. She never advanced past the first round of the French Open or Wimbledon. In 2001, she advanced to the third round, where she was defeated in straight sets by Justine Henin. Mirka has won three big tournaments in Tel Aviv, Klosters-Serneus, and Clearwater, Florida, in the United States. At 1993, she also won a competition in Langenthal, Switzerland.</p><p>Her greatest sporting triumph came after retirement, when she became Roger Federer’s public relations manager.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_Did_Roger_Federer_announced_his_retirement></span>Why Did Roger Federer announced his retirement?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Wimbledon and Grand Slam champion Roger Federer has announced his retirement from playing tennis. The Swiss player, along with Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, has long been recognized as one of the “Big Three” male professional tennis players. Tennis legend Serena Williams just announced her retirement from the sport and plans to “grow” her career in a different way. This announcement came just one month after Williams’.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel="noopener nofollow">A post shared by Roger Federer (@rogerfederer)</a></p><p>He has stated that the forthcoming Laver Cup in London will be his last ATP event. Federer will continue to play tennis even if he will not compete in any more Grand Slam tournaments or on the ATP Tour. This is a difficult decision for him because he would miss everything the trip has given him.</p><p>Federer wrote on social media, “Of all the blessings that tennis has provided me over the years, the greatest without a doubt has been the people I’ve met along the way.” “My family, my teammates, and, most importantly, the fans who keep the sport alive.”</p><p>Federer was forced to withdraw from the 2021 U.S. Open due to a knee issue. He has now undergone numerous operations and rehabilitation in an effort to recover, albeit a full recovery has proven to be more difficult than he anticipated.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_exactly_did_he_say></span>What exactly did he say?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“I also know my body’s capacities and limits,” he added, “and its message to me lately has been apparent.” “I’ve worked hard to get back into full competition fitness.” I’ve played more than 1,500 games in 21 years and am 41 years old. Tennis has been more wonderful to me than I could have anticipated, but now I must decide whether to continue competing.”</p><p>“However, there is plenty to be thankful for. I consider myself to be one of the luckiest people living since I was given a special talent for tennis and was able to practice it for much longer than I ever imagined.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_was_Federer%E2%80%99s_Surprising_Revelation_to_his_Wife></span>What was Federer’s Surprising Revelation to his Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Due to injuries, Mirka had to retire at the age of 24. Federer, on the other hand, is still going strong at the age of 40. But he did agree that, in retrospect, convincing Mirka to resign was a mistake. “Looking back on it today, I get a funny sense,” Ringier said in an interview. At the age of 40, I am still competing in tournaments and find it tough to stop. Her career ended abruptly, and I encouraged her to terminate the agony. I informed her as if it were the most trivial matter in the world.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Roger_Federer_familiar_with_cricket></span>Is Roger Federer familiar with cricket?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Federer has a strong connection to cricket. Federer is a South African citizen because his mother is from there. Lynette Federer, his mother, is from Gauteng, South Africa. He has already interacted with Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli. He played against Kohli in the Australian Open, and he will play Tendulkar at Wimbledon.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=FAQs></span>FAQs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Is Roger Federer Still Active?</strong></p><p>Roger Federer, 41, has announced his retirement from competitive tennis after a series of knee surgeries.
