He is a very complex character who can get mad at one time and still be very lovable at another.</p><p>He has boundless powers which include the ability to make himself invisible, and his only weakness seems to be his inherited asymmetriphobia, an OCD which compels him to find order in everything to avoid losing his mind.

Because of this, he is one that is very strong and at the same time, often irrational.</p><p>He is capable of unleashing madness upon anyone that stands before him. He gains great power after swallowing his weapon Bahrain so he’d be able to consume souls and be transformed into a god. He wields terror wherever he goes and the others must overcome the impossible to defeat him.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=6_Spirit_Albarn></span><strong>6.

The sisters are the complete opposite; where Liz is mature and cynical, resourceful, and terribly scared of ghosts or anything that creeps, Patty is annoyingly childish, trusting, cheery-eyed, and only goes into a rage during battle.</p><p>Their weapon forms are semi-automatic pistols that fire energy bullets which are technically Kid’s soul wavelengths. They can control each other whenever their meister is not present.</p><p><strong>See Also:&nbsp;<a href=#>15 Top Danganronpa Characters That You Will Love</a></strong></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=10_Soul_Evans></span><strong>10.
