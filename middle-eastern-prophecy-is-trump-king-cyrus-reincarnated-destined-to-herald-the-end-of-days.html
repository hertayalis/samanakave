It also represented a victory for hard-line pro-Israeli interest groups.</p><p>But Trump's most prominent electoral support group — conservative evangelicals — see it all as a biblical drama. At last, their great nation has an embassy in God's own capital city — Jerusalem. And it means cataclysmic events proclaimed by prophecy are about to take place.</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-world">Related articles</h2><p>Trump himself is at the heart of this prophecy.</p><p>His fate is seen as intrinsically tied to that of an ancient Persian king.</p><p>The President of the United States is God's right-hand man, many evangelicals believe. Trump is an imperfect tool God is using to create perfect works. This means nothing less than the end of days. And a one-way ticket to heaven.</p><h2 class=article__heading>HORSEMEN OF THE APOCALYPSE</h2><p>President Trump has surrounded himself with outspoken believers who share an end-times theology.</p><p>Vice-President Mike Pence is a stoic evangelical. He makes no secret that he devoutly believes that war in the Middle East is God's will. That God wants Israel returned to the Jews. That Armageddon is part of God's plan.</p><p>Pence openly maintains ties with Christian Zionist organisations that see this as a desirable fulfilment of biblical prophecy. His own speeches regularly repeat such imagery, with statements such as "a prophecy literally came to pass" with the establishment of a Israel in 1948.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/OVlOeFc_MQLAR5SUaFSVSWVcXOY=/16x15/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/NGRYHOZX7ZKYSJW73IWGPTAW3M.jpg"><p>"When we open the American Embassy in Jerusalem, we will in a very real sense end this historic friction, we'll embrace reality," Pence said in an interview with the Christian Broadcast Network.</p><p>Former high-profile Trump adviser Steve Bannon has also openly spoken about being a Christian Zionist. It's an evangelical faction that places particular emphasis on supporting Israel in order to ensure God's plan can be carried out.</p><p>It's a view based on Genesis 12:3, in which God promises Abraham:"I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on Earth will be blessed through you."</p><p>Put simply, you can do no wrong in the eyes of God if you support Israel.</p><p>Then there's Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Labor Secretary Alex Acosta and Housing Secretary Ben Carson … they are among 10 members of Trump's Cabinet who are prominent supporters of the Capitol Ministries group.</p><p>This is an evangelical lobby group which seeks "to teach God's Word and share the Gospel of Jesus Christ with state legislators, judges, and constitutional officers."</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><h2 class=article__heading>DEFENDER OF THE FAITH</h2><p>The Rapture cult is diverse and encompasses many Christian denominations. But it's particularly popular among US evangelical groups.</p><p>White evangelicals were Trump's most vocal, and active, voting bloc during the 2016 election campaign.</p><p>At the heart of it all is a particular interpretation of biblical prophecy — an amalgam of passages from the New Testament book of Revelations, but also the Old Testament's Daniel and Isaiah.And every preacher applies their own particular spin.</p><p>Boiled down, they believe in Armageddon — an apocalyptic Middle Eastern war — and the second coming of Jesus Christ. When this happens, 144,000 Christian souls will be granted access to Heaven.

To them, it's a sign that the Second Coming is at hand. Peace efforts are simply postponing God's will.</p><p>Oddly enough, it's a belief very similar to the prophecy Islamic State used to inspire its jihadist fighters. Here, the final showdown between Islam and infidels would bring the second coming of the prophet Jesus, which would herald the end of days. One difference is that the final battle will be sited at Dabiq in northern Syria, not Meggido (Armageddon) in northern Israel.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>Both religious views are fundamentalist.</p><p>Both believe sacred texts must be interpreted literally, in a current context, despite their many confusing contradictions and antique, illustrative prose.</p><p>Science is rejected.

There's nothing to worry about, it argues: God will "continually renew the face of the Earth until He forms a new heaven and a new Earth in the end times."</p><h2 class=article__heading>KNIGHTS OF THE CROSS</h2><p>President Trump has proclaimed his favourite priest to be First Baptist Dallas megachurch pastor Robert Jeffress.</p><p>In 2014, Jeffress wrote a book declaring that President Barack Obama was paving the way for the arrival of the Antichrist (if he wasn't the Antichrist himself).</p><p>He took a prominent stand for the President during the 2016 election campaign. But their close relationship was made obvious when he conducted a private prayer service with the Trump family on the morning of January 20, 2017 — the day Trump took office.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/VDfcNo46hF-OHL2iK2hiIyWr2wk=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/2QYZGM35OFKY2DH23KU7HGBKCI.jpg"><p>Jeffress preaches the Rapture to all who will listen. "Islam is wrong. It is a heresy from the pit of hell," he says. "Mormonism is wrong. It is a heresy from the pit of hell." The Catholic Church is led by Satan. All Jews are doomed to Hell.

"Hell is going to be filled with good religious people who have rejected the truth of Christ."</p><p>He's ecstatic that his beliefs are being mirrored by the President: "We thank you every day that you have given us a President who boldly stands on the right side of history, and more importantly on the right side of you, oh God, when it comes to Israel."</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Allow me to disagree?

Tele-evangelist Billy Graham embraced the idea. Megachurch founder Pat Robertson has made it central to his sect's appeal. And then there are the many talkback radio and YouTube preachers all vying to grow their followings.</p><p>There's also San Antonio megachurch televangelist John Hagee, a founder of Christians United for Israel and major supporter of the Jerusalem embassy move. He's a common sight at high-profile Republican Party events.</p><p>When Hurricane Katrina killed 1200 in New Orleans, he proclaimed: "New Orleans had a level of sin that was offensive to God, and they were recipients of the judgment of God for that."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/rxIPMR7j7ox_ug6C1vf6ol-aAo4=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/V6ZGC2N7YBRTVCMCEHIEMYNR7Y.jpg"><p>He repeatedly asserts the Second Coming of Jesus Christ is imminent.

But most of the US citizens filling the surrounding stands cheered a boisterous"ay-men!" when he concluded the opening prayer with: "In the spirit of Jesus Our Lord.

It's a move that will facilitate prophecy.</p><p>According to this world-view, the restoration of Jerusalem as the capital of a Jewish State is a key step towards the end of days. The Jews will get to demolish Islam's Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque, and get to build the third incarnation of their sacred temple. (The first was destroyed by the Babylonians, and the second the Romans). This, in turn, will herald Armageddon.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><h2 class=article__heading>AMERICAN GOTHIC</h2><p>The obsession of the United States with a rapturous apocalypse is deeply knit within its cultural identity. It was a core belief of the English Puritans who fled there in the 16th and 17th centuries. This has since evolved to become an integral part of the evangelical American tradition.</p><p>This theology believes God's creation has passed through the eras of "The Law" — between Moses receiving the 10 Tablets and the crucifixion of Jesus Christ — and "The Grace" — the rise and spread of the Christian Church. The final period — or dispensation — is at hand, they say. This will be the "Millennial Kingdom".</p><p>"Most evangelicals subscribe to a belief in premillennialism, the belief that the second coming of Christ will begin a 1000-year period where Christ will rule over a peaceful and prosperous Earth," doctor of religious history Neil Young told <i>Newsweek</i>. "Israel is a key part of this story, too, as Christians believe that events there are fundamental to bringing about the end times.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Of all the possible theological dog-whistles to his evangelical base, this is the biggest.

Those classifying themselves as evangelicals make up about 35 per cent of the US electorate.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/5ZWqi-Rj54BcwA7IuvdOikymzh8=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/KBYVM4WHM76JVKYOWWSP3D5I7M.jpg"><p>But this philosophy of supporting Israel brings evangelicals into direct conflict with the Middle East's own Christians — mostly Arab Palestinians — and many other international church groups and their leaders, including Pope Francis.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><h2 class=article__heading>KING CYRUS</h2><p>He swaggers with bravado.

He's also keen to remind everyone that he's "somebody that has had material success and knows tremendous numbers of people with great material success — the most material success".</p><p>He's even previously declared that he's never asked God for forgiveness.</p><p>But that doesn't bother Trump's evangelical backers. Some 81 per cent of those who identify themselves as Christian Evangelicals voted for him.</p><p>God can use the unlikeliest of men to enact his will, they argue.</p><p>They see Trump as the instrument of God's will. His personal morals and behaviour has nothing to do with it, just so long as he enacts what they see as God's will.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/h1C86b9w_Oh4_B3DabbVCjkINsU=/16x13/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/2SMF57EW4DIFHOW5BMHA2FNE2Q.jpg"><p>"For his evangelical supporters, there's a sense that Trump's unlikely election to the presidency proves that he has been chosen by God," Young told <i>Newsweek</i>. "He shouldn't have won the election, so the thinking goes, so the fact that he did — and that victory came only via the Electoral College, no less — just demonstrates that only God could make it happen."</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>The President also has precedent, they believe.</p><p>According to the Old Testament, the founder of the original Israel, King David, was an adulterer and murderer. Yet God made him king, and declared him to be "a man after my own heart".</p><p>Trump's priest Jeffress has an even more portentous parallel. He paints the controversial President's reign as similar to that of the biblical King Cyrus.</p><p>The Old Testament book of Isaiah describes Cyrus as the King of Persia and, as such, one of Israel's greatest enemies. But he was chosen by God to do his work — conquering Babylon and freeing the Jewish people.</p><p>Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, one of Trump's most vocal international supporters, also embraces the parallel: "We remember the proclamation of the great King Cyrus the Great — Persian King. Twenty-five hundred years ago, he proclaimed that the Jewish exiles in Babylon can come back and rebuild our temple in Jerusalem ... And we remember how a few weeks ago, President Donald J. Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Mr President, this will be remembered by our people throughout the ages."</p><p>Naturally many among Netanyahu's powerbase see the prophetic context of it all very differently.
