Despite fierce competition from Power 5 schools like Ohio State, Clemson, and Oregon, he committed to the University of Miami.</p><p>Braxton Berrios made an impressive debut as a true freshman, amassing 21 catches for 232 yards and scoring 3 touchdowns during the season. In 2017, he played a pivotal role in a memorable victory against Florida State, contributing two touchdown passes that led to the team’s first win against the Seminoles since 2009.</p><p>The New England Patriots recognized Berrios’s potential, selecting him in the sixth round of the 2018 NFL Draft, with the 210th overall pick. Although his initial NFL journey saw him placed on injured reserve in September 2018, he would later achieve a significant milestone. Berrios earned a Super Bowl ring when the Patriots triumphed over the Los Angeles Rams with a score of 13–3 in Super Bowl LIII. However, his time with the Patriots came to an end when he was waived during the final roster cuts on August 30, 2019.</p><p>Berrios found a new opportunity with the New York Jets when they claimed him off waivers on September 1, 2019. His second season with the Jets proved to be memorable, marked by his first career touchdown, a 30-yard pass from Sam Darnold in a game against the San Francisco 49ers.</p><p>In Week 16 of the 2020 season, Berrios demonstrated his versatility by catching a 43-yard touchdown pass from fellow wide receiver Jamison Crowder during a trick play, contributing to a 23–16 victory over the Cleveland Browns.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Braxton Berrios</a> continued to shine in the 2021 season, recording a receiving touchdown in Week 7 against the Cincinnati Bengals. He further solidified his reputation as a versatile player when he returned a kickoff for a touchdown in a 26–21 win against the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 16. His exceptional performance earned him the title of AFC Special Teams Player of the Week. Week 17 was equally impressive, with Berrios becoming the first Jets receiver to both catch and run for touchdowns in the same game. At the end of the season, he secured first-team All-Pro honors as a kick returner, highlighting his contribution to the Jets.</p><p>On March 14, 2022, Berrios re-signed with the Jets, inking a two-year, $12 million contract. His versatility continued to shine in Week 4 of the 2022 season when he executed a trick play, throwing a two-yard pass to Zach Wilson for a touchdown. This play made Zach Wilson the first Jets quarterback to score a receiving touchdown.</p><p>However, on March 9, 2023, Berrios was released by the Jets, marking the end of his tenure with the team.</p><p>Shortly after, on March 16, 2023, Berrios signed a one-year contract with the Miami Dolphins, embarking on a new chapter in his NFL journey.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jrCfmqxdnsBurtGar62nnmKvpr7RoqasZZ6awW7DzquroWc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./why-was-netflixs-1899-canceled.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why was Netflixs 1899 canceled?">&larr;
